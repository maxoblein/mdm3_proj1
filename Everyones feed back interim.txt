need clear goal 
what is the problem? 
what is the company and why?
still need to state what you are doing. 
this is what we are doing and this is our goal. 

not clear where figures and results come from 
if you have plots of something where did it come from 

introduction 
dicsussion of state of the art- literature review talk about what that is 
what is relevent in this project 
background reading

poor captions 
should stand alone to explain what it is 
most are just too short 
every figure should also be referenced in the text 
explain the results, dont just show them.

be careful with quotes, make sure they are left and right

no breaking space Figure 1 ... make sure ~ 

subplots, make a plot and put more than one plot in that figure, to describe them all in one caption 

units on figures, axis properly labelled
